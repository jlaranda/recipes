Ingredients:
 - 600g Potatoes
 - 4 Large Eggs
 - 1 Medium Onion
 - Pinch of Salt to taste
 - 5 Table Spoons Olive Oil

Directions:
1. Take a medium sauce pan, add water, salt and bring it to the boil.
2. Wash, peel and cut the potatoes (cut into slices or dice). Add to the
   water and parboil them for 5-7 minutes.
3. Meanwhile:
4. Peel and dice the onion. Heat up 2 table spoons of olive oil in a frying
   pan (bottom of the pan should be about 20cm in diameter) and add the onion.
   Sauté for about 5 minutes.
5. Now drain the potatoes (make sure you don’t overcook them – they should be
   cooked partially only to speed up the process) and add them to the pan.
    Cook for about 10 minutes, mixing (or tossing) occasionally.
6. Meanwhile:
7. Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk them with a fork. Add a pinch of salt
   and finely chopped parsley.
8. Once the potatoes are cooked, add some more oil, pour over the beaten eggs
   and reduce the heat to the lowest temperature.
9. Cook slowly until the omelette is set. Now it is time to turn it over. For
   this, use a plate (cover the pan with the plate, holding both turn the pan
   over. Transfer the omelette back onto the pan) add some more olive oil and
   cook for a further 3-5 minutes.
10. Serve with a slice of bread, tomato and salad.
